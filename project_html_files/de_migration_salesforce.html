            Landing zone in ADLS storage.
            Azure SQL Hyperscale service tier for benefits:
            - designed to support a variety of workloads
            - supports dedicated read replicas
            - most appropriate tool in Azure to handle 
            transactional data at volume, with all benefits 
            of Azure SQL server.
            - much better support for concurrency and high
            performance.
            - supports autoscaling storage up to 100TB
            (current state supports on 8 TB)
            - most cost-effective storage and compute solution
            compared to Synapse dedicated SQL pool.


            Why not use Synapse dedicated SQL pool?
            - not suited for small batch transactional workloads
            - query concurrency is limited, meaning
            queries are stuck waiting in a queue when
            all slots are occupied.
            - workload management and performance tuning requires
            routine monitoring and maintenance.
            
            Changes:
            - Adopt more reliable Azure Data Factory for pipeline design
            and orchestration.
            - Adopt ELTL instead of ETL for pipeline design.
            - Remove complex, long running data flows from
            data pipeline design to resolve limitations on
            concurrent pipeline operations, adopt ADF copy 
            activities (extract and load) and parameterized
            SQL stored procedures (transform load) for
            stable and robust performance.
            - break down complex, larger pipelines into
            smaller, atomic, reusable pipelines through
            parameterisation.

            Store procedures are powerful and resilient transformation
            toll within Azure SQL database.
            - enables performant and reliable ELT operations
            allowing to pushdown the processing workload
            towards the powerful compute power of the
            database server and performs optimally with 
            appropriate indexing and partitioning policies
            adopted for larger tables.

            parameterised store procedure can be written to encapsulate
            and secure sets of reusable code. can be used to secure 
            database by restricting the actions that can be performed
            on a given database object.
            pros:
            - data stays within integration platform, with no
            ingress or egress required from the database.
            code is fully buildable and centralized in T-SQL 
            invalud code will be idetified early.
            easier to adopt and maintain for team.
            cons-
            - some duplicative code
            - difficult to interpret.
            - less secure when dynamic
            - transformastions are limited
