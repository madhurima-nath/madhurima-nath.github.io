        <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Device health scores &amp; 
            network infrastructure maintenance</h2>
        <p>
        A statistical method based on device radio frequency (RF) metrics was developed
        to improve the approach for network infrastructure maintenance,
        for a telecommunications client facing escalating operational 
        costs from their reactive service visits. 
        The traditional approach relied on registering a service visit to 
        address to multiple customer complaints. This was not only expensive 
        but also damaged customer satisfaction through prolonged service disruptions. 
        A portion of operational expenses could be reduced if some
        repeated service visits and support calls could be decreased
        through proactive maintenance.
        <br><br>
        The proposed solution monitors the device health of customers
        and proactively identifies possible at-risk network 
        infrastructure in a smaller geo-location within a region.
        <b>The methodology successfully flagged known 
        problematic nodes with high precision in one region of the USA,
        confirming the approach's validity. </b>
        A comprehensive device health scoring algorithm was engineered using
        the hourly data available for the key RF performance metrics:
        <li>
            signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
        </li>
        <li>
            downstream receiving power
        </li>
        <li>
            upstream transmitting power
        </li>

        The device-health score plotted against six months of historical service visits
        and call rates validated the correlation that a higher device-health score
        leads to more calls and subsequently more service visits.
        A schematic plot showing this relationship is shown below:

        <br>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;"><u>Device-health score calculation</u></h3>
        To identify a reliable minimum and maximum thresholds 
        for each RF metric, required for standardisation,
        the extreme values at both ends were excluded by 
        focusing on the 5th to 95th percentile range.

        Each metric was standardised using the formula: 
        $S_i = \frac{|x_i - x_{min}|}{x_{max} - x_{min}}$ where 
        $x_i$ represented the hourly metric value from device data. 

        A weighted scoring formula transformed raw RF measurements 
        into actionable device-health scores. 
        The weight for each metric was determined by measuring the 
        slope of linear regression between call rates and the normalised metric, 
        represented as 
        
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
            $$w_i = \frac{\Delta\textit{call_rate}}{\Delta\textit{normalised_metric}_i}.$$
        </div>

        Finally, to effectively capture each metric's relative contribution 
        to service issues, the device-health score was calculated as 
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
            $$\text{device_health_score} = \sum_{i=1}^3 w_i \times S_i.$$
        </div>
         
        <br>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;"><u>Geographical high-risk customers clustering</u></h3>
        To find faulty infrastructure in a region, multiple clusters of
        customers with high device-health score were identified
        using the clustering algorithm,
        DBSCAN or Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
        It groups data points based on how densely packed they are, 
        and can identify
        clusters of various shapes and handle data with varying densities
        (<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ClusterDBSCAN.html">SQL DBSCAN code reference).</a>

        DBSCAN was implemented to find clusters of a minimum of 10 customers 
        with a device-health score of at least 0.3 after tuning the following
        parameters:
        <li>
            distance between the geometric points, e.g., distance between the 
            latitudes and longitudes of customers set to 500 metres.
        </li>
        <li>
            minimum number of points in the cluster, e.g., a minimum
            of 10 customers.
        </li>
        <b>Note</b>: 0.3 was chosen from the call rate vs device health score.
        
        <br>
        Custom SQL stored procedures were scheduled for daily execution to
        continuously provide updated device-health profiles and
        geographical concentrations of potential at-risk (high risk)
        customers across the entire region. 
        Since the clusters of custoners with high device-health scores
        covered a significant distance, it pointed to a faulty infrastructure
        instead of individual device issues.
        The continuous monitoring of such clusters enabled targeted maintenance of 
        problematic network nodes rather than addressing individual customer issues.
        
        <br><br>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;"><u>Extrapolation to the entire nation</u></h3>
        After proving the concept, the findings were cautiously extrapolated 
        nationwide, accounting for regional variations in population density, 
        thereby changing the parameters of the clustering algorithm and the
        thresholds for call rates.

        The final production solution enabled the transformation from 
        reactive to proactive maintenance scheduling based on statistical device-health indicators. 
        Field operations teams received daily reports highlighting emerging high-device-health 
        clusters requiring preventive intervention, dramatically <u>shifting resource 
        allocation from emergency response to planned maintenance</u>. This not only 
        reduced costs but improved network reliability metrics and customer 
        satisfaction scores by addressing potential failures before they 
        impacted service. The solution's ROI extended beyond direct cost 
        savings to include improved customer retention and reduced churn 
        in previously problematic service areas.
