        <h2>Network Infrastructure - something</h2>
        <p>
        A statistical method based on device radio frequency (RF) metrics was developed
        to improve the approach for network infrastructure maintenance,
        for a telecommunications client facing escalating operational 
        costs from their reactive service visits. 
        The traditional approach relied on registering a service visit to 
        address to multiple customer complaints. This was not only expensive 
        but also damaged customer satisfaction through prolonged service disruptions. 
        A portion of operational expenses could be reduced if some
        repeated service visits and support calls could be decreased
        through proactive maintenance.
        <br>
        The proposed solution monitors the device health of customers
        and proactively identifies possible at-risk network 
        infrastructure in a smaller geo-location within a region.
        A comprehensive risk scoring algorithm was engineered using
        the hourly data available for the key RF performance metrics (indicators
        of device health):
        <li>
            signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
        </li>
        <li>
            downstream receiving power
        </li>
        <li>
            upstream transmitting power
        </li>
        
        The risk score plotted against six months of historical service visits
        and call rates validate the correlation that a higher risk score
        leads to more calls and subsequently more service visits.
        Specifically, six months of historical data were analyzed 
        to identify ranges where call rates showed monotonically 
        increasing or decreasing relationships with RF metrics. By
        focusing on the 5th to 95th percentile range and 
        excluding the extreme values at both ends, the analysis 
        established reliable minimum and maximum thresholds 
        for each RF metric, creating a foundation for standardization.

        The technical heart of the solution was a weighted scoring 
        formula that transformed raw RF measurements into actionable risk scores. 
        For each metric, a standardized value was calculated using the 
        formula: $S_i = \frac{|x_i - x_{min}|}{x_{max} - x_{min}}$ where 
        $x_i$ represented the hourly metric value from device data. 
        The weight for each metric was determined by measuring the 
        slope of linear regression between call rates and the normalized metric, 
        represented as 
        $w_i = \frac{\Delta\text{CallRate}}{\Delta\text{NormalizedMetric}_i}$. 
        The final risk score was calculated as 
        $\text{RiskScore} = \sum_{i=1}^3 w_i \times S_i$, 
        effectively capturing each metric's relative contribution 
        to service issues. By processing this scoring model through custom 
        SQL stored procedures scheduled for daily execution, the system 
        continuously updated risk profiles across the network. 
        The most innovative aspect was implementing a DBSCAN 
        clustering algorithm that identified geographical concentrations 
        of high-risk customers, enabling targeted maintenance of 
        problematic network nodes rather than addressing individual customer issues.

        <!-- ### Suggested Visualization Placement:

        After the third paragraph would be ideal for 
        inserting a visualization showing the correlation between 
        increasing risk scores and service metrics. A simple chart could display:
        - X-axis: Risk score categories (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
        - Y-axis: Two metrics on separate scales or as a dual-axis chart:
        1. Average service visits per 100 customers (left axis)
        2. Average customer calls per 100 customers (right axis) -->


        Initial validation in Region 1 demonstrated compelling results, 
        identifying potential monthly reductions of approximately 4,500 
        customer calls. The methodology successfully flagged known 
        problematic nodes with high precision, confirming the approach's validity. 
        Working closely with field technicians, feedback mechanisms were 
        established to continuously refine the risk scoring model and improve
        prediction accuracy. This collaborative validation process was crucial 
        for gaining organizational buy-in and ensuring the solution addressed 
        real-world network issues.

        <!-- After proving the concept, the findings were cautiously extrapolated 
        nationwide, accounting for regional variations in network density 
        and configuration. Using a service visit rate of 0.1 (one service visit
        per ten customer calls), potential reductions of approximately 
        30K monthly customer calls and 6K service visits across the country 
        were projected, translating to approximately $8M+ in annual cost avoidance. 
        While this projection served as a directional estimate to secure executive 
        sponsorship, a phased regional rollout plan was implemented that allowed 
        for continuous refinement of the model for different geographical 
        contexts and network architectures. -->

        The final production solution enabled the transformation from 
        reactive to proactive maintenance scheduling based on statistical risk indicators. 
        Operations teams received daily reports highlighting emerging high-risk 
        clusters requiring preventive intervention, dramatically shifting resource 
        allocation from emergency response to planned maintenance. This not only 
        reduced costs but improved network reliability metrics and customer 
        satisfaction scores by addressing potential failures before they 
        impacted service. The solution's ROI extended beyond direct cost 
        savings to include improved customer retention and reduced churn 
        in previously problematic service areas.
