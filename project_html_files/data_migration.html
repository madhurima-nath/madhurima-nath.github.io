        <h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: #076a77;">Data migration into data lake 
        using data pipelines</h2>
        <p>
            SQL stored procedures are powerful and resilient transformation
            method which enables performant and reliable 
            ELTL (Extract-Load-Transform-Load) or ETL/ELT operations.

            Parameterised store procedures can be written to encapsulate
            and secure sets of reusable code. 
            The major pro is that the data stays within integration platform, with no
            ingress or egress required from the database.
            However, there are some cons of using stored procedures.
            <li>
            There is some duplicative code.
            </li>
            <li>
            At times, the code is difficult to interpret.
            </li>
            <li>
            Stored procedures are less secure when dynamic and 
            transformastions are limited.
            </li>
            
            ensuring comprehensive data 
            integrity and seamless integration.
    \item Implemented validation techniques that 
    significantly reduced migration errors and 
    enhanced overall data quality for enterprise-level data management. 
            Landing zone in ADLS storage.
            Azure SQL Hyperscale service tier for benefits:
            - designed to support a variety of workloads
            - supports dedicated read replicas
            - most appropriate tool in Azure to handle 
            transactional data at volume, with all benefits 
            of Azure SQL server.
            - much better support for concurrency and high
            performance.
            - supports autoscaling storage up to 100TB
            (current state supports on 8 TB)
            - most cost-effective storage and compute solution
            compared to Synapse dedicated SQL pool.


            Why not use Synapse dedicated SQL pool?
            - not suited for small batch transactional workloads
            - query concurrency is limited, meaning
            queries are stuck waiting in a queue when
            all slots are occupied.
            - workload management and performance tuning requires
            routine monitoring and maintenance.
            
            Changes:
            - Adopt more reliable Azure Data Factory for pipeline design
            and orchestration.
            - Adopt ELTL instead of ETL for pipeline design.
            - Remove complex, long running data flows from
            data pipeline design to resolve limitations on
            concurrent pipeline operations, adopt ADF copy 
            activities (extract and load) and parameterized
            SQL stored procedures (transform load) for
            stable and robust performance.
            - break down complex, larger pipelines into
            smaller, atomic, reusable pipelines through
            parameterisation.
