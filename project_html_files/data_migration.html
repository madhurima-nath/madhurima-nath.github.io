        <h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: #076a77;">Data migration into data lake 
        using data pipelines</h2>
        <p>
            Data migration involves moving the data from a source
            system to a new destination. It involves:
            <li>
                data profiling and assessment: identify 
                source and destination, understand
                the data structures, formats, and relationships, 
                assess the data's volume, data types, missing values,
                inconsistencies etc.
            </li>  
            <li>
                data modelling/mapping: define rules to map elements of
                the source data (fields, tables, columns) to destination 
                data elements, including any data type conversions. 
            </li>
            <li>
                migration approach: incremental vs batch, historical and
                new data, based on requirements.
            </li>

            The data is extracted from the source, transformed to clean,
            format/convert (aggregation, filtering etc.) 
            to map to the destination requirements.
            Load this into the destination system using data pipelines.
            Finally, validation and testing ensure data integrity and
            completeness of the migrated data. 
            The speed and efficiency of these data pipelines are extremely
            important as they not only incur huge costs, but are also 
            time consuming for large datasets. Data governance, 
            metadata management and data security are crucial to protect data
            during all the steps of the data migration. 
            Post-migration maintenance involves ongoing support and addressing
            any post deployment updates and/or issues.

            <br><br>
            SQL stored procedures are powerful and resilient transformation
            method which enables performant and reliable 
            ELTL (Extract-Load-Transform-Load) or ETL/ELT operations.

            Parameterised store procedures can be written to encapsulate
            and secure sets of reusable code. 
            The major pro is that the data stays within integration platform, with no
            ingress or egress required from the database.
            However, there are some cons of using stored procedures.
            <li>
            There is some duplicative code.
            </li>
            <li>
            At times, the code is difficult to interpret.
            </li>
            <li>
            Stored procedures are less secure when dynamic and 
            transformastions are limited.
            </li>

            <h3 style="font-style: italic;"><u>Data lake migration on Snowflake</u></h3>
            Within Snowflake, define storage integration, i.e.,
            connection between Snowflake and cloud storage option.
            Define stages of how the data will be loaded, i.e., replace and load full data
            or insert and append new data, or load only updated (new as well as changes
            to historical) data.
            Configure the necessary warehouses, databases and security settings.
            Recreate database schemas and objects (tables and views) to mirror the data lake structure. To load the data, Snowflake's <code>COPY INTO</code>
            command or third-party tools like Azure Data Factory could be used to transfer data.

            <br>
            In Snowflake, tasks are used to automate and schedule data processing tasks, including data migration. They are be used to execute SQL statements, call stored procedures, and manage data pipelines.
            Tasks can be scheduled to run at regular intervals or triggered by events like the arrival of new data. 
            These can be chained together to create complex data pipelines, to validate migrated data after it has been loaded into Snowflake and to handle errors and automatically suspend or resume execution based on their status.
