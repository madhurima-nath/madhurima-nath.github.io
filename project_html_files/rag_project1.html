            Knowledge support tool for sales representatives
        </h2>
        <p>
        A leading equipment rental firm chose to build
        a GenAI knowledge-based chatbot as their
        inaugural digital innovation initiative.
        This tool would leverage custom client data 
        in order to assist sales representatives
        respond to customer inquiries quicker,
        serve as an internal training hub and
        replace manual document searches. 
        In addition, internal SMEs (subject matters experts)
        needed the ability to review and update
        any response that was flagged by the end users
        as an incorrect or incomplete.
        I worked with a cloud engineer to deploy
        this chatbot using <code>OpenAI</code> on AWS platform,
        and implemented a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
        approach.
        <br>
        To understand their domain and provide relevant
        answers from their data, various documents (both 
        structured - <samp>csv, json</samp>
        and unstructured - <samp>pdf, html</samp>) were
        ingested into <code>S3 bucket</code> 
        to create a knowledge base.
        Employing RAG architecture was essential to augment
        the <code>OpenAI LLM</code> model and
        provide accurate responses.
        <code>Chroma</code> vectorstore was used
        to store the embeddings.
        Multiple <code>Lambda</code> functions were assigned
        to handle different parts of the solution, i.e., 
        processing input, returning <code>OpenAI</code> response,
        updating database with feedback from SMEs etc.
        <code>Lex</code> was the backbone of the solution,
        providing all NLP and NLU capabilities to understand
        user questions and determine best possible answers.
        <br>
        Note: There was a front-end developer who was
        responsible for the user interface.
        <br>
        <b>Solution architecture</b>
        <img src="../project_related_images/SolutionArchRAG.JPG" style="max-width: 100%;">            
        <li>
            Lex processed user input and triggered
            <code>OpenAI Lambda</code> to get response.
            <code>LangChain RetrievalQA Chain</code>
            was implemented to answer user query in a
            conversational manner.
            The prompt template was designed as per
            the requirements from the clinets, e.g.,
            answers formatted into a list
            wherever possible (and when requested by the user),
            provide hyperlinks to resources referenced
            in the answers, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>Sagemaker</code> was used to
            preprocess all the documents used for RAG approach,
            stored in <code>S3 bucket</code>.
            Data from <code>DynamoDB</code> was also
            analyzed and used to generate embeddings using
            <code>gpt3.5 model</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            All <code>LangChain</code> dependencies were
            deployed by a <code>Docker image</code>
            through <code>ECR (Elastic Container Registry)</code>
            hosted on the <code>EC2</code> instance and
            used by a <code>Lambda</code> function to
            connect responses to <code>Lex</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The expert interface designed for SMEs to review
            and update chatbot answers was connected to
            the rest of the backend architecture using 
            <code>API Gateway</code> and <code>Lambda</code>
            functions.
        </li>
        <li>
            The metadata from the chatbot as well as
            the data collected from the SMEs were stored
            in <code>DynamoDB</code>.
        </li>
            The chatbot provided accurate results
            when tested extensively by the
            users from the firm on a variety of questions.
            There was also a ~22% reduction in response
            time of customer inquiries.
