                Healthcare Q&A virtual assistant
            </h2> 
            <p>
                A healthcare technology start-up client wanted
                to improve their application interface by 
                incorporating GenAI to boost customer experience.
                At the current state, the interface performed
                clustering on the biopharmaceutical and medtech datasets
                and generated plots representing the different groups.
                The objective was to build a Q&A chatbot to
                assist both experts and non-medical users 
                to easily gain insights from these plots.
                A prototype chatbot powered by the 
                <code>Anthropic Claude LLM</code> on AWS Bedrock
                was 
                <br>
                Ingesting data as-is in the <code>LLM prompt</code>
                increased latency, token usage and thus cost.
                Pre-processing data to extract relevant information
                and summarizing it helped to improve accuracy and reduce
                latency.
                Implementing <code>LLM agent</code> with carefully
                designed prompt and the appropriate tools provided
                a flexible framework to answer various types questions,
                as well as the capability to expand the scope of
                questions in the future.

                <li>
                    The numeric results from the clustering analysis
                    were parsed to extract the relevant information
                    from the structured <samp>json</samp> heatmaps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    LLM pipeline #1: <code>LLM chain</code> 
                    to summarize descriptions
                    of characteristics of each group which represent
                    various medical conditions or symptoms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    LLM pipeline #2: <code>LLM chain</code>
                    to propose a name for each group/clusters
                    from the graphs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    LLM pipeline #3: <code>LangChain agent</code>
                    to answer questions about the groups.
                    <li>
                        A custom agent to interact with AWS Bedrock
                        and Anthropic Claude.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Graph specific question tools to gain
                        answers from the heatmaps.
                    </li>
                </li>
                At the end of the engagement we were able to deliver
                a fully functioning chatbot that could be
                integrated with their existing application interface.
