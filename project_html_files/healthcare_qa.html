            Healthcare Q &amp; A virtual assistant
        </h2> 
        <p>
        A healthcare technology start-up client wanted
        to improve their application interface by 
        incorporating Generative AI to boost customer experience.
        At the current state, the interface performed
        clustering on the bio-pharmaceutical and medical technical datasets
        and generated plots representing the different groups.
        A Q &amp; A chatbot using <code>Anthropic Claude LLM</code> 
        (Large Language Model) was developed on AWS Bedrock to
        assist both experts and non-medical users 
        to easily gain insights from these plots.

        <br>
        Ingesting data as-is in the <code>LLM prompt</code>
        increased latency, token usage and thus cost.
        Pre-processing data to extract relevant information
        and summarising it helped to improve accuracy,
        optimise for latency, and return an answer 
        in ~20 seconds on average.
        Implementing <code>LLM agent</code> with carefully
        designed prompt and the appropriate tools provided
        a flexible framework to answer various types questions,
        as well as the capability to expand the scope of
        questions in the future. 
        <br>
        Note: Collaborated with design team, who developed the front-end interface.

            The numeric results from the clustering analysis

        </li>
        <li>
            LLM pipeline #1: <code>LLM chain</code> 
            to summarize descriptions
            of characteristics of each group which represent
            various medical conditions or symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
            LLM pipeline #2: <code>LLM chain</code>
            to propose a name for each group/clusters
            from the graphs.
        </li>
        <li>
            LLM pipeline #3: <code>LangChain agent</code>
            to answer questions about the groups.

                A custom agent to interact with AWS Bedrock
                and Anthropic Claude.

                Graph specific question tools to gain

        At the end of the engagement,
        a fully functioning chatbot was delivered that could be
        integrated with their existing application interface.
