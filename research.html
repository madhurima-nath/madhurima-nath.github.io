                Application of Network Reliability to 
                Analyze Diffusive Processes on Graph Dynamical Systems
                </a>
                     academic journey in physics began with a master's
                    research in cold atomic physics, 
                    resulting in a publication in Physical Review A, 
                    followed by a PhD where I worked in an 
                    interdisciplinary research lab. 
                    There, I applied computational physics 
                    and graph theory to both traditional physics 
                    problems and real-world challenges 
                    like epidemic outbreaks.

                    This experience with population dynamics 
                    data provided me solid foundations in 
                    data science and machine learning. 
                    At Slalom, I design data and ML solutions 
                    across industries, working both independently 
                    and with larger technical teams on 
                    enterprise-wide implementations.

                    I maintain connections with 
                    scientific communities through 
                    peer review while supporting 
                    initiatives that bridge academic 
                    research and industry applications,
                    reflecting my commitment to knowledge 
                    exchange and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
