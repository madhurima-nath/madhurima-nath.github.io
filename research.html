                    <strong>Application of Network Reliability to Analyze Diffusive Processes on Graph Dynamical
                        Systems</strong></a> &mdash;
                Moore-Shannon network reliability serves as a global statistic to explore the behavior of diffusive
                processes on networks. It depends on both network topology and the dynamics of the process, giving
                the probability that the system reaches a desired configuration. The research demonstrates its
                utility across three domains: epidemic outbreak modeling, invasive species tracking through
                international food trade, and partition function estimation for the Ising model.

            <p>
                Developed new approaches to evaluate Moore-Shannon network reliability using Bernstein basis functions,
                Monte Carlo simulations, and statistical perturbative methods. The reliability polynomial
                R(x;&nbsp;G,&nbsp;D,&nbsp;P) gives the probability that a graph dynamical system satisfies a desired
                property under given dynamics. Established an adaptive kernel density estimation method using Bernstein
                polynomials to find optimal sampling strategies that maximise information gain while minimising
                estimation error.

            <h4>Epidemic Outbreak Modeling on Contact Networks</h4>

                Simulated real-world epidemic outbreak and intervention scenarios on the National Longitudinal Study of
                Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) dataset using network reliability. Compared SIR dynamics on
                observed contact networks against four classes of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to determine
                whether standard network statistics suffice to characterise epidemic outcomes. The analysis revealed
                that attack rate depends on a mixture of structural properties beyond degree distribution, clustering,
                and centrality measures &mdash; providing policymakers with improved estimates.

                Developed an algorithm using Moore-Shannon network reliability to estimate energy states of an
                interacting magnetic system modeled on 1D and 2D lattices. By treating spin flips as a diffusive
                process on a graph dynamical system, established that the reliability polynomial is analogous to the
