                    Moore-Shannon network reliability serves as a global statistic to explore the behavior of diffusive
                    processes on networks. It depends on both network topology and the dynamics of the process, giving
                    the probability that the system reaches a desired configuration. The research demonstrates its
                    utility across three domains: epidemic outbreak modeling, invasive species tracking through
                    international food trade, and partition function estimation for the Ising model.
