    Healthcare Q&A virtual assistant
</h2> 
<p>
    A healthcare technology start-up client wanted
    to improve their application interface by 
    incorporating GenAI to boost customer experience.
    At the current state, the interface performed
    clustering on the biopharmaceutical and medtech datasets
    and generated plots representing the different groups.
    The objective was to build a Q&A chatbot to
    assist both experts and non-medical users 
    to easily gain insights from these plots.
    A prototype chatbot powered by the 
    <code>Anthropic Claude LLM</code> on AWS Bedrock
    was 
    <br>
    Ingesting data as-is in the <code>LLM prompt</code>
    increased latency, token usage and thus cost.
    Pre-processing data to extract relevant information
    and summarizing it helped to improve accuracy and reduce
    latency.
    Implementing <code>LLM agent</code> with carefully
    designed prompt and the appropriate tools provided
    a flexible framework to answer various types questions,
    as well as the capability to expand the scope of
    questions in the future. 
    <br>
    Note: We were not responsible for the front-end development.

    <li>
        The numeric results from the clustering analysis
        were parsed to extract the relevant information
        from the structured <samp>json</samp> heatmaps.
    </li>
    <li>
        LLM pipeline #1: <code>LLM chain</code> 
        to summarize descriptions
        of characteristics of each group which represent
        various medical conditions or symptoms.
    </li>
    <li>
        LLM pipeline #2: <code>LLM chain</code>
        to propose a name for each group/clusters
        from the graphs.
    </li>
    <li>
        LLM pipeline #3: <code>LangChain agent</code>
        to answer questions about the groups.
        <li>
            A custom agent to interact with AWS Bedrock
            and Anthropic Claude.
        </li>
        <li>
            Graph specific question tools to gain
            answers from the heatmaps.
        </li>
    </li>
    At the end of the engagement we were able to deliver
    a fully functioning chatbot that could be
    integrated with their existing application interface.
